# Loaded7&trade; Mobile Shopping Cart
Based on the original [osCommerce platform](http://www.oscommerce.com "osCommerce Online Merchant"), **[Loaded 7]**&trade; includes new **mobile shopping cart** with responsive template designs in both admin and catalog.
A whole new object oriented<sup>[1]</sup> template system for extensible markup aside of the core cart development. Rework to core payment and shipping modules.
## Responsive Design
**Responsive Design** is rarely seen in open source shopping carts. We've taken it to the next level with full support for next generation mobile devices.

## Open Graph Protocol
The Open Graph Protocol often referred by it's acronym, [ogp], was originally created at [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com "Facebook") and is inspired by [Dublin Core](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dublin_Core/ "Dublink Core"), [link-rel canonical](http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2009/02/specify-your-canonical.html "Google Blog on rel canonical"), [Microformats](http://microformats.org/ "Microforats specification"), and <abbr title="Resource Description Framework">[RDFa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDFa "Resource Description Framework")</abbr>. It allows your consumers to share pages in a variety of social networks. The social network will seek out the **[ogp]** information in the code to display the correct image, title description, type of page and other useful information. This feature was released in [7.000.0.0](https://github.com/loadedcommerce/loaded7/releases/tag/7.000.0.0 "Release 7").
