# Loaded7&trade; Mobile Shopping Cart
Based on the original [osCommerce platform](http://www.oscommerce.com "osCommerce Online Merchant"), **[Loaded 7]**&trade; includes new **mobile shopping cart** with responsive template designs in both admin and catalog.
A whole new object oriented<sup>[1]</sup> template system for extensible markup aside of the core cart development. Rework to core payment and shipping modules.
## A Responsive Ecommerce Web Application
**Responsive Design** is rarely seen in open source shopping carts. We've taken it to the next level with full support for next generation mobile devices.
